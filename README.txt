Perfect 👍 You’re basically asking me to generate a **ready-to-use README.md** for your project *The Dicktective*. I’ll fill in everything with clean Markdown so you can just drop it in and tweak later.

Here’s a draft:

⚡ Now you’ll just need to:
- Replace `yourname` and `partner` with actual names/links.
- Add screenshots or a logo under the title for more “wow” factor.

Do you want me to also **generate the `requirements.txt`** that matches this README (with only the essentials you’ll actually use)?

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
